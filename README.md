个人自用代理规则，主要目的是为了reject一些漏网之鱼的广告和追踪器，同时将一部分明文http连接升级到TLS协议。不定期更新，尽量保证不含有重复的规则。

Personal self-use proxy rules, the main purpose of this repo is to REJECT some advertising and trackers which are not in the rules written by others. Also upgrade a portion of plaintext http connections to the TLS protocol. It is updated from time to time. I'll try to ensure that it does not contain duplicate rules.
